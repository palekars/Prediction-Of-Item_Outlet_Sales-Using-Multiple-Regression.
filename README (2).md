# Prediction Of Item_Outlet_Sales Using Multiple Regression.
The project goal of project is to predict Item_Outlet_Sales using Multiple Regression Model of Machine Learning.


## Data Set
Data set of Supermarket from Kaggle was used consisting of information about Oulet and Items , such as Item fat content, visibility, MRP, outlet size,outlet location ,Estd Year etc in which Item_Outlet_Sales was target variable.
## Methodology
For preprocessing the data project uses the techniques like handling missing values , standardizing numerical features, and encoding categorical variables.
This also includes the checking of assumptions of data.
        
The processed data then splitted into the training and testing dataset into 70 % and 30 %  proportions respectively.Training dataset is used to train the   model and testing dataset used to test the model.
   
Various graphs plotted for visualization of data 

For statistical analysis EDA was performed.
  
Selection of features that are more relevant for prediction.
  
By feeding the training dataset to the models each of the model is trained.

The project uses metrics like Accuracy and R-square score as evaluation parameters for models.

For predicting value of targeted value 'Multiple Regression' model is used.
 
By feeding the training dataset to the models each of the model is trained.

The project uses metrics like Accuracy and R-square score as evaluation parameters for models.
## Naive Baye's classifier
Naive Baye's classifier was used to predict the missing values.
## Result
Model performs with 50%-53% of accuracy
